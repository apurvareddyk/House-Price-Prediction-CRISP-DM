\begin{abstract}
Accurate house price prediction is essential for various real estate stakeholders, from property developers to buyers. In this paper, I demonstrated a predictive modeling process using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, leveraging the power of XGBoost for its superior performance on structured data. Using the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset, I focus on the entire process from business understanding to model deployment. After applying feature engineering, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning, the XGBoost model achieves high accuracy with an R² score of 0.92, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

\section{Introduction}
House price prediction has long been a challenge in the real estate industry due to the various factors influencing property values. The emergence of machine learning, particularly ensemble models like XGBoost, offers a reliable solution to this problem. This study follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which provides a structured and repeatable process for data mining. The project’s aim is to accurately predict house prices using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques." The dataset consists of various features that may affect housing prices, including the overall quality of the house, square footage, and the year of construction.

\section{Related Work}
House price prediction has been addressed through various methods, ranging from traditional regression models to more sophisticated techniques like random forests and gradient boosting. Recent work has demonstrated the superiority of XGBoost in handling structured data, particularly in regression tasks. This study builds upon these works, using the CRISP-DM methodology to guide the entire process, from data exploration to deployment.

\section{CRISP-DM Methodology}
The CRISP-DM process consists of six phases, each critical to the success of the project.

\subsection{Business Understanding}
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on a variety of features. Accurate predictions can benefit real estate developers, buyers, and investors by providing insights into the future value of properties. The key metric for success in this project is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R² score, which will measure the performance of the model.

\subsection{Data Understanding}
The dataset used in this study contains 81 features, including categorical and numerical variables. Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OverallQual}: Overall material and finish quality of the house.
    \item \textbf{GrLivArea}: Above-ground living area square footage.
    \item \textbf{YearBuilt}: Year the house was originally built.
    \item \textbf{GarageCars}: Size of the garage in car capacity.
\end{itemize}

To understand the distribution of the target variable `SalePrice`, the following distribution plot was created. This visualization highlights the spread of house prices in the dataset, showing a skewed distribution where most prices fall between 100,000 and 300,000.

    \caption{Distribution of SalePrice}
    \label{fig:saleprice}
\end{figure}
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the relationships between these features and the target variable, `SalePrice`. Correlation analysis revealed that features such as `OverallQual` and `GrLivArea` had strong positive correlations with the target variable.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Preparation}
The data preparation phase involved several key steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Handling Missing Values}: Features with missing values were imputed using the mean for numerical variables and the mode for categorical variables.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: A new feature, `TotalSF`, was created by combining `1stFlrSF` and `2ndFlrSF`. This new feature better captures the total livable area of the house.
    \item \textbf{Encoding Categorical Features}: One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables to convert them into numerical format.
    \item \textbf{Scaling Features}: Features such as `GrLivArea` and `TotalSF` were scaled using the `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeling}
For the modeling phase, several machine learning algorithms were tested, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model due to its ability to handle complex relationships between features and its regularization techniques, which prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the number of estimators, learning rate, and maximum tree depth. The tuned XGBoost model achieved an MSE of 12,035.58 and an R² score of 0.92, making it the most accurate model for this problem.


\subsection{Evaluation}
The XGBoost model was evaluated using the following metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Squared Error (MSE)}: 12,035.58
    \item \textbf{R² Score}: 0.92
\end{itemize}

The model’s performance was further validated using a residual plot, which confirmed that the residuals were randomly scattered around zero, indicating a good fit with no systematic bias.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Deployment}
The final model was saved using `joblib`, allowing it to be deployed for real-time predictions. A Flask API was created to allow users to input key features such as `GrLivArea` and `OverallQual` and receive predicted house prices in real-time.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper demonstrates a comprehensive approach to house price prediction using the CRISP-DM methodology and the XGBoost model. The model achieved high accuracy, with an R² score of 0.92, making it a reliable tool for real estate prediction. Future work could explore the integration of other ensemble methods or deep learning models to further improve accuracy.
