# House Price Prediction Using CRISP-DM Methodology

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive **house price prediction** project using the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology. The project follows each phase of the CRISP-DM framework, from understanding the business problem to deploying a machine learning model.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and overall property quality. By following the CRISP-DM methodology, we ensure that the entire process, from data preparation to model deployment, is systematic and repeatable.

### Key Features:
- **Business Understanding**: Defining project objectives and the problem statement.
- **Data Understanding**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identifying important features.
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating machine learning models, including hyperparameter tuning, with **XGBoost** emerging as the best model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.
- **Deployment**: Demonstrating how the model can be deployed for real-world use, including saving the model for future predictions.

## CRISP-DM Phases:

### 1. Business Understanding
We begin by defining the business problem, which is to predict house prices based on various attributes. Accurate predictions can assist in decision-making for real estate professionals, buyers, and investors.

### 2. Data Understanding
In this phase, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features that influence house prices. We use visualizations and summary statistics to explore relationships between variables.

### 3. Data Preparation
The data preparation phase involves cleaning and transforming the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering to create new, relevant features that improve model accuracy.

### 4. Modeling
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated. **XGBoost** was chosen as the best-performing model based on its accuracy and evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model.

### 5. Evaluation
The model was evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² score**. The final tuned model showed strong predictive power, explaining a significant portion of the variance in house prices.

### 6. Deployment
The trained model is saved for future predictions, and deployment options are discussed. A simple API using Flask can be built to deploy the model for real-time predictions.

## Conclusion
This project successfully implements a house price prediction model using the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured approach to data mining and predictive modeling. The **XGBoost** model provides accurate and reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for real estate pricing.
